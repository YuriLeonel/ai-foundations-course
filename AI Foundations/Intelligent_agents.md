# Analyzing Intelligent Agents

## 1. What Are Intelligent Agents?

* **Definition**: Systems capable of perceiving their environment and acting upon it to achieve defined goals.
* **Examples**:

  * Google Maps
  * Google Assistant
  * Amazon Alexa

---

## 2. Agents in Traditional Computing

* **Characteristics**:

  * Embedded in an environment with perception capabilities.
  * Operate using fixed programming and pre-defined rules.

* **Example**:

  * A refrigerator thermostat that activates the compressor to maintain temperature.

## 3. Difference Between Standard and Intelligent Agents

| Type of Agent         | Key Characteristics                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Agent**    | Operates using fixed rules; decisions are deterministic.               |
| **Intelligent Agent** | Guided by rationality models; analyzes inputs to maximize performance. |

* **Examples of Intelligent Agents**:

  * Robotic vacuum cleaners
  * Autonomous cars
  * Virtual assistants

## 4. How a Virtual Assistant Works

The functioning of a virtual assistant follows a **Perception–Reasoning–Action** cycle:

1. **Perception**

   * Captures voice input and converts it into text.

2. **Reasoning**

   * Queries databases to process and interpret the request.

3. **Action**

   * Executes the required task, such as playing music on a streaming platform.

* **Supporting Components**:

  * **Sensors**: Input devices (e.g., microphones).
  * **Actuators**: Output devices (e.g., speakers).

## 5. Classification of Intelligent Agents (Norvig & Russell)

Norvig and Russell propose four main categories:

1. **Rule-Based Agents**

   * Make decisions strictly following pre-defined rules.

2. **Model-Based Agents**

   * Represent and infer environmental states using internal models.

3. **Goal-Based Agents**

   * Operate with specific objectives (e.g., navigation applications).

4. **Utility-Based Agents**

   * Select actions that maximize performance according to a defined utility function.
