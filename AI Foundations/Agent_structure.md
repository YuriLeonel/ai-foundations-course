# Intelligent Agents: Cyclical Functioning and Types

## Cyclical Operation of Agents

Intelligent agents operate through a **continuous cycle**:

1. **Perceive** the environment.
2. **Interact** with the environment (when necessary).
3. **Process** the gathered information.
4. **Generate** responses or actions.

This cycle ensures adaptability and responsiveness across different contexts.

## Types of Agents

### 1. Reactive Agents

* **Definition**: Operate based on predefined rules, responding only to immediate perceptions.
* **Strength**: Fast and efficient in simple environments.
* **Limitation**: Lack of memory or contextual awareness.
* **Example**: A robotic vacuum cleaner that changes direction upon detecting an obstacle.

### 2. Model-Based Agents

* **Definition**: Use abstract representations (models) of their environment.
* **Strength**: Capable of handling dynamic contexts by storing memory of past interactions.
* **Limitation**: Require additional computational resources for maintaining and updating models.
* **Example**: A robotic vacuum cleaner that creates and navigates using a map of the environment.

### 3. Goal-Based Agents

* **Definition**: Operate with clearly defined objectives and select actions that best achieve those goals.
* **Strength**: More flexible decision-making aligned with specific outcomes.
* **Limitation**: May struggle when goals conflict or are poorly defined.
* **Example**: A robotic vacuum cleaner that prioritizes cleaning the dirtiest areas or conserving battery power.

### 4. Utility-Based Agents

* **Definition**: Evaluate the quality of potential actions using a utility function, aiming for optimal performance.
* **Strength**: Capable of balancing competing objectives and maximizing efficiency.
* **Limitation**: Require complex calculations and well-designed utility functions.
* **Example**: A robotic vacuum cleaner that scores different cleaning strategies to optimize overall performance.

## Web Applications of Intelligent Agents

In online environments, intelligent agents are widely used to:

* **Personalize content** in news platforms and e-commerce.
* **Optimize user experience** by combining goal-based and utility-based approaches.
* **Maximize outcomes** such as engagement, satisfaction, and sales.

## Final Considerations

When selecting the appropriate type of agent, it is essential to weigh **computational cost** against **desired functionality**:

* **Simple agents** (reactive) demand minimal processing power but provide limited adaptability.
* **Advanced agents** (model-, goal-, or utility-based) enable more sophisticated decision-making but require significantly greater computational capacity.
