# Evolution of Computing and Artificial Intelligence

## 1950s: The Dawn of Computing

* **Early Computers**:

  * Utilized vacuum tubes (e.g., **ENIAC**).
  * Large, power-hungry machines primarily used for **military calculations**.
* **Alan Turing and the Turing Test**:

  * Proposed the idea of a machine that can **imitate human behavior** in interactions.
  * Modern example: **generative AI tools**.

## 1955: Dartmouth Seminar

* Recognized as a **landmark event** in AI history.
* Established **Artificial Intelligence as a formal area of computer science**, focused on creating intelligent systems.

## Early Applications

* **Mathematical problem-solving algorithms**.
* **Game-playing programs**.
* Use of **slide rules** and early computational tools in engineering for simplified calculations.

## AI Winter

* Period marked by **reduced interest and funding** in AI research.
* Limited progress due to **technological and methodological constraints**.

## Evolution of Computing

* Development of **smaller, more powerful chips**.
* Emergence and growth of the **internet**, enabling greater connectivity and data sharing.

## 1980s: Expert Systems

* **Expert systems** for specialized tasks, such as **medical diagnosis**.
* Provided **intelligent decision support** in various professional domains.

## Late 1990s – Early 2000s

* **Mass adoption of personal computers and smartphones**.
