## Example: Movie Streaming Recommendation Algorithm

1. **Data Collection** – Gather user viewing history and preferences
2. **Pattern Analysis** – Identify trends and correlations
3. **Personalization** – Adapt recommendations to each user
4. **Recommendation Generation** – Produce a tailored list of movies
5. **Presentation** – Display suggestions in the user interface
6. **Feedback and Learning** – Incorporate user responses (likes, skips, ratings)
7. **Continuous Updates** – Improve accuracy with ongoing data
